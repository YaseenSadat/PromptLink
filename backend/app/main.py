  main.py â€” Entry point for the FastAPI backend application
===================================================================

This file initializes and configures the FastAPI server. It performs
the following core tasks:

1. Creates the FastAPI application instance.
2. Registers the main API router from the app's routing module.
3. Enables CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to allow communication
   between the frontend (e.g., React/Vite app) and this backend API.

This is the central configuration file that ties together routing
and middleware to start the backend server.
